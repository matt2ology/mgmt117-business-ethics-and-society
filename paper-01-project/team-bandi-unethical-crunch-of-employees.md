# The Dark Shadows of Mismanagement: Unmasking the Noire of Team Bondi's Demise

It's all fun and games until the developers are hurt. Characterized by Big Tech (FAANG companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) the tech industry often portray themselves as "work hard, play hard" companies; where, the office is a place to collaborate and develop products and services. It is also a place to adorn your cubical with miniatures, have Nerf gun fights, and after a meeting relax with a deep tissue massage from the onsite masseuse. By extension video game studios like Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Blizzard Entertainment, and Ubisoft (to name a few) all market themselves in the same light, "work hard, play hard" culture, as Big Tech. However, at times the reality gap between what is advertised and marketed versus what is experienced cannot be more divided. The video game industry has witnessed numerous success stories, but it has also encountered its fair share of controversies and challenges. One such case is the mismanagement of Team Bondi, a game development studio that, despite investing over a hundred million dollars in production over an eight-year period, ultimately faced bankruptcy following the release of their sole game, "L.A. Noire."

Problem statement:
The problem with Team Bondi's mismanagement, specifically, is their unreasonable demands imposed on developers. These demands exacerbate unethical behaviors within the organization and generate conflicts with fundamental aspects of human nature.

Thesis statement:
The most important lesson from Team Bondi's mismanagement is their unreasonable demand of developers. This is important because it creates a toxic work environment, imposes 80-hour weeks on their developers, and results in the production of an inferior quality product.

Forecast statement:
If game development studios continue to perpetuate unreasonable demands on developers, exacerbating unethical behaviors and conflicts with human nature, the industry will witness a perpetuation of toxic work environments, continued imposition of excessive work hours, and a continued decline in the quality of products. By examining these issues, we gain valuable insights into the importance of ethical leadership and employee well-being in the game development industry.

Ethical frameworks provide guidelines for organizations to cultivate ethical behavior, create a positive work culture, and align their practices with fundamental aspects of human nature. The mismanagement at Team Bondi, as stated in the thesis, exacerbated unethical behaviors within the organization and conflicted with human nature.

According to Collins and Kanashiro, ethical organizations prioritize the well-being of their employees, promote fairness, and uphold transparency and accountability (Kanashiro, section 1.3). Team Bondi's mismanagement can be seen as a violation of these principles. By imposing excessive work hours and creating a toxic work environment, the organization neglected the well-being and work-life balance of their developers. This conflicts with the ethical imperative to treat employees with dignity and respect; furthermore, the mismanagement at Team Bondi demonstrates a lack of transparency and accountability. Ethical organizations strive for open communication, honesty, and fairness. However, Team Bondi's unreasonable demands and unethical behaviors suggest a failure in fostering a transparent and accountable work environment.

By applying ethical frameworks, such as the consequentialist approach where whether something is good or bad depends on its outcomes (The Ethics Centre), it becomes apparent that Team Bondi's mismanagement deviated from ethical best practices outlined by Collins and Kanashiro. The organization's actions created a toxic work environment, imposed excessive work hours, and compromised the quality of their product.

While additional and specific ethical frameworks and perspectives from Collins and Kanashiro's "Business Ethics: Best Practices for Designing and Managing Ethical Organizations" could provide a more in-depth analysis and support, the consequentialist approach highlights the ethical ramifications of their actions. By evaluating the outcomes and consequences of their unreasonable demands, it becomes clear why their mismanagement ultimately led to their downfall.
