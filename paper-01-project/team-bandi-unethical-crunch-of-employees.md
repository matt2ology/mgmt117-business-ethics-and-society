It's all fun and games until the developers are hurt.

However, at times the reality gap between what is advertised and marketed versus what is experienced cannot be more divided.

Since the split from the electrical engineering discipline in the 1960s (Shallit, 1995), both the entertainment (video games) and engineering (platforms and services) sector, software development as a profession is a young and new budding industry. Software engineers had to learn how to organize, structure, and manage projects as code/software development is different from traditional project management used in budding construction and car manufacturing.
