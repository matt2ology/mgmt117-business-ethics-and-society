It's all fun and games until the developers are hurt. Characterized by Big Tech (FAANG companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) the tech industry often portray themselves as "work hard, play hard" companies; where, the office is a place to collaborate and develop products and services. It is also a place to adorn your cubical with miniatures, have Nerf gun fights, and after a meeting relax with a deep tissue massage from the onsite masseuse. By extension video game studios like Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Blizzard Entertainment, and Ubisoft (to name a few) all market themselves in the same light, "work hard, play hard" culture, as Big Tech. However, at times the reality gap between what is advertised and marketed versus what is experienced cannot be more divided.

However, at times the reality gap between what is advertised and marketed versus what is experienced cannot be more divided. The video game industry has witnessed numerous success stories, but it has also encountered its fair share of controversies and challenges. One such case is the mismanagement of Team Bondi, a game development studio that, despite investing over a hundred million dollars in production over an eight-year period, ultimately faced bankruptcy following the release of their sole game, "L.A. Noire."

As with all things new there growing pains to be endured and lessons to be learned; for example, the video game studio Team Bandi (pronounced: /ˈbɒndaɪ/ BON-dy) over the span of eight years, spending over a hundred million dollars in production, and in the end filed for bankruptcy after being forced to release their one game: "L.A. Noire".

The most important lesson from Team Bondi's mismanagement is their unreasonable demand of developers that exacerbate the unethical behaviors in their organization and conflicts with human nature. This is important because it creates a toxic work-anxiety environment, imposes 80 hour weeks on to their developers, and produce a product of inferior quality.
