It's all fun and games until the developers are hurt. The tech industry, lead by Big Tech like Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet, often portray themselves as "work hard, play hard" companies where the office is a place to collaborate and develop products; and, is a place to adorn your cubical with miniatures, have Nerf gun fights, and enjoy free meals. By extension video game studios (to name a few) like Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Blizzard Entertainment, and Ubisoft all market themselves in the same light as Big Tech.
