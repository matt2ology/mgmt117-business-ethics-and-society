## Ethical Framework/Perspective (1-2 pages)

Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that places emphasis on maximizing overall utility or happiness for the greatest number of people. It evaluates the morality of an action based on its consequences and seeks to achieve the greatest net benefit or utility for society as a whole (Collins and Kanashiro, Glossary). In simpler terms: do the most good to the most number of people.

In the context of balancing economic growth and responsible water management in the semiconductor industry, utilitarianism provides a framework for decision-making that considers the overall well-being of stakeholders. It acknowledges that economic growth is important for societal progress, but also recognizes the need to address the environmental and social consequences, such as water scarcity and environmental degradation.

By applying utilitarian principles, decision-makers in the semiconductor industry can weigh the potential benefits and costs associated with different approaches to water management. They consider the following:

1. The long-term impacts on the environment
2. The local communities
3. The future generations

Utilitarianism prompts the industry to optimize water efficiency, minimize waste, and explore sustainable practices that reduce negative externalities. It encourages the industry to seek innovative solutions, collaborate with stakeholders, and invest in research and development to continuously improve water management practices; furthermore, utilitarianism promotes stakeholder satisfaction by involving local communities, employees, consumers, and regulatory bodies in decision-making processes. Their concerns and preferences are considered to maximize overall utility and well-being.

Ultimately, utilitarianism provides a valuable ethical lens for the semiconductor industry to strike a balance between economic growth and responsible water management. It guides decision-makers in considering the broader consequences of their actions and encourages them to pursue strategies that maximize overall utility, leading to a more sustainable and ethical approach to water management in the industry.

## Case Description and Application

### Context and background: Chip Fabrication

When one consider water shortages, he or she often associate them with actions such as shorter showers and reduced flushing, acknowledging the importance of conserving water at home. While saving water in residential settings is crucial, it is essential to recognize that water usage in agricultural and industrial sectors far surpasses that of residential households. Specifically, semiconductor manufacturing is known for its substantial water consumption. A significant portion of this water is dedicated to wafer cleaning processes. In fact, around 30-40% of the steps involved in modern wafer fabrication require some form of wafer cleaning (MKS Instruments).

For example, the wafer fabrication process includes a stage known as "wet cleaning," involves a series of sequential wash steps aimed at eliminating organics, metals, and particles from the wafer surface. In between each of these washing steps, water is utilized to rinse off the chemicals used in the preceding stages (MKS Instruments).

Semiconductor companies are unable to utilize standard tap water from household sinks for wafer cleaning; instead, they must utilize ultrapure water, a technical-industry term to describe water that has undergone an exceptional level of purification that adheres to exceptionally stringent specifications, specifically tailored for this purpose.

Within the industry, there is a concerted effort to eliminate what are referred to as "killer particles", which are particles of a size that can impact the delicate nano-architecture of a chip. These particles may consist of waste from microorganisms, organic matter, dissolved metals, gases, and other contaminants. It is imperative to thoroughly remove as many of these particles as possible from the water used in the fabrication process.

The process of generating and verifying the purity of ultrapure water is an intricate and demanding task. It involves more than a dozen meticulous steps, with certain steps being repeated across multiple cycles. To produce approximately 1,000 gallons of ultrapure water, around 1,600 gallons of city water are required. Note that a single 8-inch wafer can consume over 2,000 gallons of ultrapure water (Parekh et al.).

### Context and background: Arizona Water

Currently, approximately 40% of the overall water demand is fulfilled through the utilization of nonrenewable groundwater. Surface water sources, primarily the Colorado River, contribute 57%, while the remaining portion is supplied by reclaimed water. Consequently, when the Colorado River fails to meet the required water supply, the shortfall is compensated by extracting water from underground sources (ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES). This practice is not sustainable in the long run.

Primarily, the state government has effectively regulated water consumption by redirecting water from agricultural areas to urban regions. Historically, agriculture has been the largest consumer of water in the American Southwest, accounting for nearly 90% of total water demand in 1980 (ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES). However, the conversion of farmland into urban and suburban spaces over time has contributed to a reduction in overall water usage.

Despite the state's efforts to develop a comprehensive plan to manage water demand, the outcomes have been insufficient, and the reliance on groundwater extraction persists. This ongoing reliance on groundwater pumping is a significant concern that raises apprehension about the sustainability of current water practices.

### Context and background: So why Arizona

So how does it make economic sense for a rational government to want to put a semiconductor fab in Arizona? Two predominant reasons.

One, the high-profit and high-value nature of semiconductor manufacturing incentivizes the state to bear the costs, even if it entails investing in water infrastructure or reallocating water allotments from other entities.

The state receives significantly higher financial compensation for hosting foundries on its land compared to other land uses. A research paper from 2012 conducted a comparative analysis of the economic value of various land uses within the city of Chandler, Arizona, where the fabs are located. The four land uses examined were high-value semiconductor manufacturing, industrial manufacturing, single-story office buildings, and retail establishments (Hubler et al.).

Two, the industry's ability to invest in advanced water recycling and reuse technologies. Because it's a high profit industry they have the capacity to invest in water-saving, reuse, and recycling methods (Business for Water Stewardship). Consequently, a significantly larger proportion of water, surpassing that of other land uses, has the potential to be effectively returned to the wastewater system.

Therefore, when considering the foundries themselves, the additional advantages offered by Arizona, such as a readily available pool of educated talent (local colleges/universities and former employees of competing companies in the area), tax incentives, and more, outweigh the primary concern of water scarcity.

### Case Description

This case revolves around the water problem faced by the semiconductor industry, specifically in dry regions such as Arizona. The semiconductor manufacturing process requires a significant amount of water, particularly for wafer cleaning, which poses ethical dilemmas. The state's economic dependence on the semiconductor industry, coupled with the scarcity of water resources, has created challenges in balancing economic growth and responsible water management. This case scrutinizes the ethical dimensions of the semiconductor industry's water usage, the potential impacts on local communities and ecosystems, and the need for an ethical framework to guide decision-making and address the water problem effectively. It examines the industry's sustainability practices, justice considerations, and responsibility to ensure a comprehensive approach that aligns economic growth with responsible water management.

### Application

The application of ethics is paramount in addressing the water problem faced by the semiconductor industry while balancing economic growth and responsible water management. By integrating considerations of sustainability, justice, and responsibility, semiconductor companies can navigate the complex ethical challenges associated with their water consumption. This essay explores how the industry can apply these ethical principles to guide decision-making and propose a holistic approach that harmonizes economic prosperity with the imperative of responsible water management. By examining the industry's sustainability practices, justice considerations, and responsibility, we can establish a framework that promotes long-term viability, equitable resource allocation, and accountability.
