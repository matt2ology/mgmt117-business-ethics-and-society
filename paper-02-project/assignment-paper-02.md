Your paper will identify an ethical issue, elaborate on the problem or issue through application to a case study, and offer recommendations to address the problem/issue in your case. It is an analytical paper, which is more than a description of a problem or descriptions of research about it. You will state a thesis about the problem that is supported with evidence.

## **Paper Format, Required Sections and Recommended Lengths**

Your paper should follow this format: 2,500 words, 12-point font, double-spaced, and 1inch margins. You’ll use [American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition style Links to an external site.](https://csus.libguides.com/APAstyle)for your in-text citations and reference page.

### _Title Page (not included in word count)_

- Include the title of your paper, your name, the course, and the number of words (not including the title page or references). The title is an encapsulated summary of your paper and is the first (and sometimes only) opportunity to capture the reader’s attention. Avoid boring, generic titles such as “Paper 1” that don’t tell the reader what the paper is about. At the same time, avoid cute or funny titles that distract the reader.

### _Introduction: 1 page_

- Your introduction should identify an ethical issue or dilemma, state an argument (thesis), and forecast the content of the paper. Problem, thesis, and forecast statements are different. A problem statement defines the issue or dilemma; the thesis reflects your position; and, the forecasting statement previews what is ahead in the same order as presented in the body of the paper.

### _Ethical Framework/Perspective (1-2 pages)_

- Your paper should include an ethical framework or perspective. All concepts (central to the ethical issue or perspective) should be fully and accurately defined, and the relationships among concepts should be explained.

### _Case Description and Application: 2-3 pages_

- You should select a case study that is topical (current) and interesting. You will describe the case, explain the relation of the ethical problem to the case, and analyze the problem through the development of main claims that relate to the central message (thesis statement) of the paper. Main claims accurately apply ethical perspectives/concepts to ethical issues.

### _Recommendations:1-1.5 pages_

- You will develop and evaluate recommendations, drawing on the ethical perspective/framework and with supporting evidence explaining the effectiveness in addressing the problem.

### _Conclusion: 1 page_

- The conclusion restates the aims of the paper and summarizes your main points. Avoid introducing new claims or arguments in the conclusion that are not in the body of the paper.

### _References (not included in word count)_

- Your references include resources from authors that you cited in the body of the paper. Do not include works consulted but not cited. Make sure you follow APA [American Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition style Links to an external site.](https://csus.libguides.com/APAstyle)for reference page. Complete reference information helps the reader find the original source if needed.
