## Chapter Summary

This chapter provides a six-step process for determining the ethics of job candidates. Hiring personnel should notify job candidates about the organization’s ethics job screen and diligently gather information in a way that does not violate [the Civil Rights Act of 1964](../_inbox/The%20Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964.md). Potential sources of ethics information about job candidates include résumés, reference checks, background checks, personality tests, interview questions, and drug tests.
