The substantially revised Third Edition integrates the most current research findings; includes three new chapters on corporate governance and stakeholder relationships, global sustainability, and global corporate citizenship; and explores timely topics through new case studies on the opioid crisis, the \#MeToo movement, climate change, and business responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
