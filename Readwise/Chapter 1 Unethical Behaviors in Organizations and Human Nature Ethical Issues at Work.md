- A well-managed organization is a community of people on a common mission to be effective, efficient, and ethical. An organization is a community, not just a bunch of individuals, and a community of people who are both rational and emotional, not robots.
- Your mission as a manager is to develop a sense of a common mission among this community of people to accomplish goals (effective) without wasting resources (efficient), in a manner that respects each personâ€™s dignity and integrity (ethical). The financial well-being of organizations depends on employees appropriately serving the needs of customers, owners, and other employees. If employees are not ethical, then the effectiveness and efficiency accomplishments will be short-lived.
